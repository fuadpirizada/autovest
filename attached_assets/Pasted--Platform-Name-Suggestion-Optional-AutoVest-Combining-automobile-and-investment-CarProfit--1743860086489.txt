🌐 Platform Name Suggestion (Optional)
AutoVest – Combining "automobile" and "investment"
CarProfit – Simple and direct
YieldRides – A modern, catchy name suggesting ROI from cars
🚘 Core Concept
Users invest real money to purchase virtual (or real, if applicable) cars through the platform. These "cars" generate weekly or monthly returns based on their package type. After a specific period (e.g., 1 week or 1 month), users can request withdrawals of their earnings or reinvest.

🎨 Frontend Design Goals
Super modern, sleek UI – Think Web3 style or fintech UI/UX (neumorphism, gradients, glassmorphism)
Dark/light mode toggle
Interactive animations – Animated charts, car animations, investment meters, earnings growth, etc.
Responsive – Mobile-first design, seamless on all screen sizes
Gamified elements – e.g., animated dashboards showing car speed = return speed
